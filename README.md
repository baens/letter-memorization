# Letter Memorization Site

This project was created to help my kid to learn her lower case and upper case letters. It is a
simple web application that can be used offline or online. It is intended to be "saved to home screen"
for ease of use and to appear like an installed application.

The operations are pretty simple. Swipe left or right to change the letter but keep the case. Swipe
up or down to change the letter and the case.
